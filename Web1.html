        <h2>The Digital Divide</h2>
        <p><b>This term refers to the disparity between individuals, communities, or societies
             that have access to modern information and communication technologies and those 
             that do not.</b> This gap can result from various factors, including socioeconomic
              status, geographic location, education, and age.</p>
        
        <h3>Internet:</h3>
        <p>Access to the internet is essential for communication, information retrieval,
             and online services. A lack of internet access limits individuals' ability to
              engage in educational and professional opportunities.</p>
        
        <h3>Computers:</h3>
        <p>Computers are crucial tools for work, education, and personal use. Without
             access to computers, individuals may struggle to acquire the necessary skills 
             for the digital age, limiting their career prospects and educational opportunities.</p>
        
        <h3>Smartphones:</h3>
        <p>Smartphones provide mobile access to the internet and a range of applications. 
            They are increasingly used for communication, banking, education, and entertainment. 
            Those without smartphones may miss out on important information and services.</p>
        
        <h3>Digital Literacy:</h3>
        <p>Digital literacy refers to the ability to effectively use digital technologies to 
            find, evaluate, create, and communicate information. Individuals lacking digital 
            literacy skills may face challenges in navigating technology, limiting their ability 
            to participate fully in the digital world.</p>
